 *
 *
 *	\section  Problem
 *
 *				Develop an interrupt driven software driver for a 2x24 LCD with an 
 *				onboard KS0066U dot matrix controller. 
 *				This driver is to be used with the latest build of FreeRTOS. 
 *				It should allow for the direct writing of data to the LCD. 
 *
 *  \subsection Design/Decomposition
*				
*				The drivers for the dot matrix controller will be able to write to both lines of the LCD display. 
*				This will be done by implementing APIs that can be called from the latest FreeRTOS OS distribution. 
*				All driver definitions, functions, and configurations will be written following FreeRTOS naming conventions for was of use.
*				The APIs will give instructions to the dot matrix controller. These instructions will be available through API calls. 
*				The available instructions to call will include turning the display on and off, initializing the display, clearing the display, 
*				change the entry mode of the display, change the cursor mode, change the cursor position, write a string to the display, 
				and write a variable to the display. An API call will also be available to pass custom instructions or data to the dot matrix controller.
				
 *  \subsection Testing
 
				To test the LCD display drivers, a working FreeRTOS build will be used to create a single task. 
				This task will be used to host each API call individually to test for proper usage from each API call. 
				A full system test will be done by using every API call in the task, followed by a write command to the LCD to ensure each instruction works. 
				This will ensure each instruction works properly with the other instructions in the driver.
				
 * \subsection Documentation
				
				Doxygen will be used to provide detailed documentation of all code done for the LCD driver. 
				Each code file, function, and variable will have proper documentation, stating the purpose of the item being documented, 
				both briefly and in detail. As well, each code file and function will have a revision history. 
				All code will contain useful comments in-line using Doxygen hooks. The end result shall be useful documentation that is easy to follow. 
				This final documentation shall include call and caller graphs so flow within the code file can be understood. 
				Any file that does not pertain to the LCD driver will not be included or documented within doxygen, including FreeRTOS code.

 * \subsection Version Control
	
				Version Control will be implemented using Git. Working in a group of four requires the use of a distributed version control system. 
				Git has the feature set to clone, edit, and push changes back to the working code. All changes will receive their own commit, 
				with the text of the commit being brief information as to what was changed. 
				The main working repository will be hosted on a cloud-based sharing service, such as GitHub. 
				This will allow for all persons editing the code to be able to clone and work from the most recent revision of the code.
 
				Using GitHub will allow for easy hosting of the remote Git repository. Due to the fact that many of the people in our group are limited 
				by the network settings and securities of apartment complexes, this will work nicely. Assigning one person to be the integration manager, 
				all other members of the group will work as developers. The manager is the person who originally uploads the code, and therefore has the 
				responsibility to merge changes into that repository. The developers clone the managerâ€™s repository to make changes, and notify the manager 
				when they want their changes merged with the blessed repository. Every member of the group will get the chance to be the manager, giving them 
				the experience to do a merge.

/*! \page Usage LCD Library Usage

	\tableofcontents
	
	The purpose of this page is to highlight the functions that can be called
	from the library and how they are used. This library is used to drive an
	LCD using the KS0066U dot matrix controller.
	
	\section Defines Defines
	\subsection Wiring LCD Wiring
	The LCD needs wired so that there are 8 data pins and 3 "command" pins. The
	3 command pins are Register Select (RS), Read/Not Write (R/!W), and Enable
	(E). The 8 data pins are always plugged into their own port, with the data
	pins 0-7 being port pins 0-7. The 3 command pins are plugged into a port,
	with RS being pin 0, RW being pin 1, and E being pin 2. The ports default
	to PORTK for the data pins and PORTJ for the command pins. These may be
	changed via the defines LDP and LCP in the header file. The Data Definition
	Registers LDDR and LCDR should also being changed according to the assigned
	ports.
	
	\subsection wrap Text Wrapping
	The "configTEXT_WRAP" setting is used to define if text wrapping should be
	enabled when calling the "vLCD_WRITE_STRING" command. This automatically
	moves to the second line of the display when the first line is full when set
	to 1.
	
	\subsection bitmode 4-bit/8-bit Mode
	The BITMODE definition is used to define if the display is to be used
	in 8-bit mode or 4-bit mode. A define of "BITMODE8" will set the display
	to use 8-bit mode, where a define of "BITMODE4" will set the display to
	use 4-bit mode.
	
	\subsection Cursor Cursor Blink and Show
	The configuration of the display can be changed so that the cursor is shown,
	or is set to blink. This is done by changing two configuration options.
	configCURSOR_SHOW will show the cursor if set to 1, and hide it if set to 0.
	configCURSOR_BLINK will blink the cursor if set to 1, and hide it if set to
	0.
	
	\subsection twoline	Two Line/One Line Mode
	The number of lines enabled on the display can be either both lines or the
	top line. To enable just the top line, set "TWO_LINE_MODE" to 0. To enable
	both lines, set "TWO_LINE_MODE" to 1.
	
	\subsection font Font Size
	Two font sizes exist for the display, both 5x11 dots and 5x8 dots. When
	"FONT_TYPE" is set to 0, the 5x8 dot format is used. When "FONT_TYPE" is set
	to 1, the 5x11 dot format is used.
	
	\subsection Mode Increment and Shift Mode
	The configuration of the shift mode can be changed to either increment or
	entire shift. Setting the define "INCREMENT_MODE" to 1 will set the display
	to increment, where setting the define "ENTIRE_SHIFT_MODE" to 1 will set the
	display to shift on data write.
	
	\section functions Functions
	\subsection Initialization vLCD_INITIALIZATION()
	The initialization function is used to initially set up the display. This
	function configures the ports used by the display, sets the display's entry
	mode and text size, turns on the display while setting the cursor settings,
	then clears the display. The display should be on, the text cleared, and the
	cursor at the home position.
	
	\subsection write_command vWRITE_COMMAND_TO_LCD(RS,data)
	Writes instructions or characters to the LCD. The input
	parameters for the display are the Register Select state and the data
	to be written. The Register Select state is '0' to write a command and '1'
	to write data. The data input is the value to be put on the data ports of
	the LCD.
	\note This command is not intended to be used directly by the user, but may
	be called if the user wishes to use a command not available through function
	calls contained in this library.
	
	\subsection write_string vLCD_WRITE_STRING(string)
	Writes an input string to the LCD at the cursor's current
	position. This will overwrite and current characters on the display. If text
	wrapping is enabled, the text will automatically move from line 1 to line 2
	if overflow happens.
	
	\subsection clear vLCD_CLEAR()
	Clears both lines of the display and returns the cursor to the
	home position.
	
	\subsection clear_top vLCD_CLEAR_TOP()
	Sets the cursor for the home position of the top row, writes
	a string of 24 spaces, then returns the cursor to the home position of the
	top row.
	
	\subsection clear_bottom vLCD_CLEAR_BOTTOM()
	Sets the cursor for the home position of the bottom row, writes
	a string of 24 spaces, then returns the cursor to the home position of the
	bottom row.
	
	\subsection onoff vLCD_ON_OFF()
	Toggles the on/off status of the LCD. If called, the LCD will
	turn off if it is on, and turn on if it is off.
	\note Using vWRITE_COMMAND_TO_LCD to turn the display on and off will not
	change the variable used to track the display, which may cause undesirable
	results when calling this function.
	
	\subsection length xLCD_Get_Length()
	Returns the number of available characters remaining on the
	LCD as an 8-bit unsigned integer. The value is calculated from the position
	of the cursor.
	
	\subsection goto vLCD_GO_TO_POSITION(x,y)
	Moves the cursor to a position on the LCD. X is the horizontal position
	0-23, and y is the vertical position 0-1.
	
	\subsection tophome vLCD_HOME_TOP_LINE()
	Moves the cursor to the home position of the top line.
	
	\subsection bottomhome vLCD_HOME_BOTTOM_LINE()
	Moves the cursor to the home position of the bottom line.
